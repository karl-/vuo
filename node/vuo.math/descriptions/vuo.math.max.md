Selects the value that is greater than or equal to all the other values.

Examples: 

   - The maximum of 2 and 6 is 6. 
   - The maximum of 2 and -6 is 2. 

`Position` is the location of the maximum value in the list, with 1 being the first item. If the maximum value appears multiple times in the list, `Position` outputs the first position where it appears.

If there are no values, both `Maximum` and `Position` output 0.

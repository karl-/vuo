Selects the value that is less than or equal to all the other values.

Examples: 

   - The minimum of 1 and 4 is 1. 
   - The minimum of 1 and -4 is -4. 

`Position` is the location of the minimum value in the list, with 1 being the first item. If the minimum value appears multiple times in the list, `Position` outputs the first position where it appears.

If there are no values, both `Minimum` and `Position` output 0.

Outputs the OSC message's address and first data value.

If the message contains data of a type other than float64/double, you may need to unspecialize the `Data 1` port (right-click and choose Revert to Generic Data Type) and specialize it to the appropriate type (right-click and choose an item under Set Data Type).

See the [vuo.osc](vuo-nodeset://vuo.osc) documentation for information about how OSC data types are converted to Vuo types.

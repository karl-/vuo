Outputs the OSC message's address and first 2 data values.

If the message contains data of types other than float64/double, you may need to unspecialize the corresponding `Data` output ports (right-click and choose Revert to Generic Data Type) and specialize them to the appropriate types (right-click and choose an item under Set Data Type).

See the [vuo.osc](vuo-nodeset://vuo.osc) documentation for information about how OSC data types are converted to Vuo types.

Fires an event each time the Leap Motion device provides new hand- and finger-tracking data.

If this node is not firing events:

   - Confirm that the Leap device is plugged in.
   - Check that your Leap service is running (the Leap service bar in the top right toolbar should be green).
   - Make sure your Leap Motion software is up to date. Vuo requires version 2.0.5 or later. You can check your version by going to Leap service bar > Settings... > About. You can download the most recent version from the [Leap Motion website](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop/).

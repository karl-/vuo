This node is useful when you know the ID of the MIDI input device that you want. For example, you can use it in place of [Specify MIDI Input by Name](vuo-node://vuo.midi.make.input.name) if there are multiple devices with the same name and you know the ID of the one you want. If you don't know the ID, then you can instead use [Specify MIDI Input by Name](vuo-node://vuo.midi.make.input.name) or [List MIDI Devices](vuo-node://vuo.midi.listDevices2).

   - `ID` â€” The device's ID, which is 0 or greater.

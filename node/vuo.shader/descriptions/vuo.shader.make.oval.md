Creates a graphics shader that paints a 3D object with an oval and a halo.

   - `Oval Color` — The color that fills the oval.
   - `Oval Width` — The size of the oval, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Oval Sharpness` — How sharp the edge of the oval is.  A value of 0 means the edge is blurry; a value of 1 means the edge is sharp.
   - `Halo Color` — The color of the soft area surrounding the oval.

This shader ignores lighting.

Nodes for creating graphics shaders to be used to paint 3D objects.

A **shader** controls how a 3D object is rendered, such as its color, texture, and lighting. Shaders are an efficient way to add effects to 3D objects because they take advantage of graphics card acceleration. 

You can connect these nodes to nodes from the [vuo.scene](vuo-nodeset://vuo.scene) node set to draw 3D scenes.

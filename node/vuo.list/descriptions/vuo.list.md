Nodes for creating, rearranging, and selecting items from lists.

Lists keep their items in a specific order. For example, in this list of texts... 

   - *pumpkin*
   - *apple*
   - *rhubarb*

... item 1 is *pumpkin*, item 2 is *apple*, and item 3 is *rhubarb*. As the list is sent through a composition, the items stay in that order.

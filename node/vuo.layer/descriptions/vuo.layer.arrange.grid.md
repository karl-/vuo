Moves layers so that they are evenly arranged in a grid.

This node takes the first layer and places it in the top, left of the grid, and it continues rightward, then downward.

   - `Layers` — The layers to arrange in a grid.
   - `Scale To Fit` — If true, each scalable layer is scaled proportionately to fit within its grid cell. If false, layers' scales are left unaltered.  Real Size layers are never scaled.
   - `Anchor` — The point within the grid that should be fixed at `Position`.
   - `Position` — The point within the composite image where the grid should be placed, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Width` and `Height` — The size of the grid along the `X` and `Y` axis, in Vuo Coordinates. 
   - `Columns` and `Rows` — The number of grid cells along the `X` and `Y` axis.

Creates a layer that provides a field into which the user can enter a number.

   - `Rendered Layers` — The group of rendered layers containing the layer. Connect this to the [Render Layers to Window](vuo-node://vuo.layer.render.window) node's `Rendered Layers` output port.
   - `Value` — The number value to be displayed in the field.
   - `Placeholder Value` — The number to show in the field when no user input is present.
   - `Maximum Decimal Points` — @todo
   - `Cursor Color` — @todo
   - `Anchor` — How to align the text field relative to the `Position`, both horizontally and vertically.
   - `Position` — The text field's position, in Vuo Coordinates.  Width and height will be automatically determined from the size of the rendered text and the minimum width and height as set by the theme.
   - `Theme` — The theme to use when rendering the text field.

Creates a Window Property consisting of a pointer interaction (the position and button status).

Interactions are used by UI widgets.  By default, Vuo automatically provides interactions for the system mouse.  Using this node, you can replace that with interactions from a custom device (such as Leap Motion or a USB HID controller).

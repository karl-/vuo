Creates a color from RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha/opacity) components. 

   - `Red`, `Green`, `Blue` — Typically range from 0 to 1, representing the sRGB colorspace.  Numbers outside this range may be used for high dynamic range imaging.
   - `Opacity` — Ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

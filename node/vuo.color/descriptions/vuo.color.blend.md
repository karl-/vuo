Blends two colors into a single color. 

   - `Background` — The background color (bottom layer) to blend.
   - `Foreground` — The foreground color (top layer) to blend.
   - `Blend Mode` — The way that the colors should be blended. For information about blend modes, see:

   - `Foreground Opacity` — The opacity that the foreground color should have in the blended color, ranging from 0 to 1.

Nodes for working with mathematical logic (*true* and *false* values).

These nodes are useful for making decisions within a composition, especially when connected to the `Which` input port of a `Select Input` or `Select Output` node. 

These nodes operate on **Boolean** values (also known as logical values, truth values, or binary values). These values can be either *true* or *false*.

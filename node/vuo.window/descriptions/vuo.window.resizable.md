Creates a Window Property that enables or disables the window to be resized by the user. 

If a window is not resizable, then it won't change size when the user drags on its corner. (The [Change Window Size](vuo-node://vuo.window.size) or [Lock Window Aspect Ratio](vuo-node://vuo.window.aspectRatio) nodes can resize the window, but the user still won't be able to resize it.)

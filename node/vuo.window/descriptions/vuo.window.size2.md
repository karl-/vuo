Changes the size of a window.

   - `Width` and `Height` — The size of the window's content area.
   - `Unit` — Whether the window's size is defined using points or pixels.
      - In Points mode, the window's physical size will stay the same when dragged between a Retina and non-Retina display, and the number of pixels covered by the window will change.
      - In Pixels mode, the window will resize itself when dragged between a Retina and non-Retina display in order to cover the same number of pixels.
      - See the [Image](vuo-nodeset://vuo.image) node set documentation for more information about points and pixels.

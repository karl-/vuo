Distorts the object by moving its vertices to the corners of a grid.

   - `Step Size` — The distance between grid lines, in Vuo Coordinates. At (0,0,0), the object is unchanged.
   - `Center` — The position from which the grid appears to grow.  At (0,0,0), the grid appears to grow from the center.

This node also sharpens the object's edges, like `Facet 3D Object`.

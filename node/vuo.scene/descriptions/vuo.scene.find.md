Searches a 3D object and its children for any 3D objects matching both the type and name, and outputs matches in a list.

- `Object` — The 3D object to search.
- `Name` — The name to check for when determining if a 3D object is a match.  If left empty the `Name` parameter is ignored when comparing 3D objects.
- `Type` — The type of scene object to restrict matches to.

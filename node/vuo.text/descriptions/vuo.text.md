These nodes are for working with text. 

Almost all Vuo nodes use the UTF-8 encoding for the Unicode character set.  This means that they can handle ASCII characters (such as the English/Latin alphabet) as well as others, such as accented characters, non-Latin alphabets, symbols, and emoji.  Nodes with `ASCII` in the title use just the [ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (not full Unicode).

You can enter multiple lines of text into a text input editor by using Option-Return to insert line breaks.

Several nodes in this set — such as `Cut Text`, `Insert Text`, and `Find Text` — use an index number to represent a position in the text.  Index 1 represents the first character.

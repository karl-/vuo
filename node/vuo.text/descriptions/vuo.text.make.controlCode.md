Creates a new text value from a `Control Code`.

- `Control Code` — The special character to make into text.
- `Text` — The special character as a `VuoText` value.

Unix, Windows, and older macOS versions all recognize different characters as meaning "New Line".  You can use this node along with [Append Texts](vuo-node://vuo.text.append) to string together multiple lines of text with line breaks.

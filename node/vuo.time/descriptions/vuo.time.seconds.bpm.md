Converts seconds per beat to beats per minute (bpm). 
 
For example, this node would convert 0.5 seconds per beat to 120 beats per minute. 

This is useful for converting between tempos used in music and seconds used in Vuo nodes (such as [Fire Periodically](vuo-node://vuo.time.firePeriodically2)).

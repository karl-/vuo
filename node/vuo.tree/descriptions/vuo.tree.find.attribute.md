Finds all children of a tree that match a given attribute.

Searches this tree and its children for an attribute named `Attribute`, and compares the attribute's value to `Value` using `Value Comparison`. For example, if `Value Comparison` is "begins with", this node searches for trees whose attribute named `Attribute` has a value that begins with `Value`.

If `Include Descendants` is false, this node only searches the immediate children of the tree. If `Include Descendants` is true, it also searches the tree's grandchildren and further descendants.

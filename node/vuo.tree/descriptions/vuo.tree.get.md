Gives information about a tree.

   - `Name` corresponds to the element name in XML or the name in an object's name-value pair in JSON.
   - `Attributes` correspond to the attributes of an element in XML.
   - `Content` corresponds to the text enclosed by an element in XML or the value in an object's name-value pair in JSON.
   - `Children` corresponds to the elements within an element in XML or the objects within an object in JSON.

For example, a tree created from XML `<product sku="rock">Handcrafted pet rock</product>` would have name `product`, content `Handcrafted pet rock`, an attribute named `sku` with value `rock`, and no children.

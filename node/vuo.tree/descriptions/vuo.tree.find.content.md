Finds all children of a tree that match a given piece of content.

Compares the content of this tree and each of its children to `Content` using `Comparison`. For example, if `Comparison` is "begins with", this node searches for trees whose content begins with `Content`.

If `Include Descendants` is false, this node only searches the immediate children of the tree. If `Include Descendants` is true, it also searches the tree's grandchildren and further descendants.

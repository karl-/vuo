Outputs the value of a single attribute of the tree.

Attributes of a tree correspond to attributes in XML. For example, the XML `<species status="endangered">P. paniscus</species>` has an attribute named `status` with value `endangered`.

`Attribute` is the attribute's name. If the tree doesn't have an attribute with that name, this node outputs empty text.

Outputs the attributes of a tree.

Attributes of a tree correspond to attributes in XML. For example, the XML `<species status="endangered">P. paniscus</species>` has an attribute named `status` with value `endangered`.

This node outputs a dictionary whose keys and values are the attribute names and values.

Removes either the first or last column from a table.

   - `Include Header` â€” If *true*, `Removed Column` includes the header (first row value). If *false*, `Removed Column` has one fewer item; the first item in `Removed Column` comes from the second row of the table.

If the table has no columns, this node outputs an empty list for `Removed Column` and the original (empty) table for `Modified Table`.

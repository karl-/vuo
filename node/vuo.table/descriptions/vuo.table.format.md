Turns a table into CSV- or TSV-formatted text.

You can use this node to export data for use in a spreadsheet application. Use this node to convert the table to [CSV (Comma-Separated Values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) or [TSV (Tab-Separated Values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) format and the [Save Data](vuo-node://vuo.data.save) node to save it to a file. In your spreadsheet application, import the file.

Each row of the table becomes a line in the output text.

Each item in the output text is enclosed in quotation marks.

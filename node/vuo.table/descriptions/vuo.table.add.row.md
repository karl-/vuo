Inserts a row in a table, either before the first row or after the last row.

   - `Values` â€” The values in the row to add, in order from first to last column, including the header column if any. If there are fewer added values than columns in the table, the last columns in the modified table will contain empty text for this row. If there are more added values than columns in the table, the modified table will have columns added at the end, containing empty text for the other rows.

Inserts a column in a table, either before the first column or after the last column.

   - `Values` â€” The values in the column to add, in order from first to last row, including the header row if any. If there are fewer added values than rows in the table, the last rows in the modified table will contain empty text for this column. If there are more added values than rows in the table, the modified table will have rows added at the end, containing empty text for the other columns.

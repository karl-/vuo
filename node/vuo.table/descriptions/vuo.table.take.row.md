Removes either the first or last row from a table.

   - `Include Header` â€” If *true*, `Removed Row` includes the header (first column value). If *false*, `Removed Row` has one fewer item; the first item in `Removed Row` comes from the second column of the table.

If the table has no rows, this node outputs an empty list for `Removed Row` and the original (empty) table for `Modified Table`.

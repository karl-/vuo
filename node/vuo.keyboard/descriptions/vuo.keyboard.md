These nodes are for capturing input from the keyboard. 

These nodes can be used either to provide keyboard controls for a composition (for example, making the arrow keys move a game avatar) or to receive text typed. If providing keyboard controls, then typically you'd want the `Receive Keyboard Buttons` node. If receiving text typed, then typically you'd want the `Receive Keyboard Typing` node.

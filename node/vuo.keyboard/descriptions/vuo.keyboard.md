Nodes for capturing input from your computer's keyboard.

These nodes can be used either to provide keyboard controls for a composition (for example, making the arrow keys move a game avatar) or to receive text typed. If providing keyboard controls, then typically you'd want the [Receive Keyboard Buttons](vuo-node://vuo.keyboard.button2) node. If receiving text typed, then typically you'd want the [Receive Keyboard Typing](vuo-node://vuo.keyboard.type2) node.

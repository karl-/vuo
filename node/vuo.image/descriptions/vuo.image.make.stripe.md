Creates an image with a stripe pattern.

   - `Color A` and `Color B` — The colors of the stripes.
   - `Stripe Width` — The average width of each stripe, in Vuo Coordinates. If `Coverage` is 0.5, this value is the exact width of each stripe.
   - `Sharpness` — How sharp the edges of the stripes are. When 0, the edges are blurry; when 1, the edges are sharp.
   - `Angle` — The counterclockwise rotation of the stripes, in degrees.
   - `Coverage` — The proportion a stripe covers in each pair of stripes. As the value increases, the Color B stripes become wider and the Color A stripes become narrower.
   - `Center` — An origin point where two stripes meet.
   - `Width` — The image's width, in pixels.
   - `Height` — The image's height, in pixels.

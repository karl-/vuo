Finds an audio output device that is connected to the computer running the composition.

This node is useful when you know the ID of the audio output device that you want. For example, you can use it in place of `Make Audio Output from Name` if there are multiple devices with the same name and you know the ID of the one you want. If you don't know the ID, then you can instead use `Make Audio Output from Name`, `Make Audio Output from Model`, or `List Audio Devices`.

   - `ID` â€” The device's ID, which is 0 or greater.

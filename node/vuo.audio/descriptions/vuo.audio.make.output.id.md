This node is useful when you know the ID of the audio output device that you want.

If you don't know the ID, then you can instead use [Specify Audio Output by Name](vuo-node://vuo.audio.make.output.name), [Specify Audio Output by Model](vuo-node://vuo.audio.make.output.model), or [List Audio Devices](vuo-node://vuo.audio.listDevices2).

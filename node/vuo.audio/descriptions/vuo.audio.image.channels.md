Creates an image of audio amplitudes.

Each horizontal line in the image corresponds to a channel of audio samples.  (The height of the image in pixels equals the number of channels.)

Each pixel in the line represents the amplitude of a single sample â€” medium grey is zero amplitude; black and white represent extreme negative and positive amplitudes.  (The width of the image in pixels equals the number of samples per sample buffer.)

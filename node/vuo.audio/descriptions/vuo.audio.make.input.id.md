This node is useful when you know the ID of the audio input device that you want. For example, you can use it in place of `Make Audio Input from Name` if there are multiple devices with the same name and you know the ID of the one you want. If you don't know the ID, then you can instead use `Make Audio Input from Name`, `Make Audio Input from Model`, or `List Audio Devices`.

Changes the volume of the audio channels.

This node uses a rough approximation of perceived loudness, so that doubling the `Loudness` input value will make the audio sound twice as loud. 

   - `Loudness` â€” The volume of the output relative to the input. At 1, the volume is unchanged. At 2, the volume is doubled. At 0, the volume is silent.

Nodes for working with 3D rotations specified using quaternions.

A **quaternion** is a way of representing a rotation in 3D space using 4 coordinates (X, Y, Z, W). Unlike rotations expressed in Euler angles (yaw, pitch, and roll; or angles about the X, Y, and Z axis), quaternions avoid the problem of gimbal lock.
